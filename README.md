# BrickSmash
A BrickOut-like game built with the Pygame library


Requirements: 
To run this file, you must have Python 3 installed on your machine along with the latest version of the Pygame library.

Upon execution, press the space button to start the game. At the moment, there is no "winning" screen. The game must be restarted manually (plan to fix).
